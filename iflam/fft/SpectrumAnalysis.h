 *
 * outMagSpectrum: pointer to a magnitude spectrum. Its length must at least be
 * size/2
 *
 * in_dB: flag indicating wether the magnitude spectrum should be
 * calculated in dB
 *
 * Discussion:
 *
 * the real valued time signal is first weighted with a Hamming window of the
 * same size and then transformed in the frequency domain. The squared
 * magnitudes of the resulting complex spectrum are copied into the
 * outMagSpectrum vector and then converted to dB if so requested. Since the
 * input signal is real, the magnitude spectrum is only half the size (note
 * that the Nyquist term is discarded) as the input signal.
 *
 * Value ranges:
 *
 * the input signal is expected to be in a Q7.24 format in the range [-1, 1)
 * which means that the integer parts should be zero the ouput magnitude
 * spectrum is in Q7.24 format with a range of [-128, 0) when calculated in dB.
